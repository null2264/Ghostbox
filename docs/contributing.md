# Contributing to Ghostbox

Thank you for your interest in Ghostbox!

When contributing to Ghostbox, please first discuss the change you wish to make by [opening an issue](https://github.com/null2264/Ghostbox/issues).

## Opening an PR (pull request)

1. Smash that "fork" button on GitHub to make a copy of the repo.
2. Clone the repo locally, then begin work on a new branch (eg not `develop`).
3. Push your branch to your fork.
4. Once pushed, GitHub should provide you with a URL to open a new merge request right in your terminal. If not, do it [manually](https://github.com/null2264/Ghostbox/pulls).
