# Ghostbox

Ghostbox is a frontend for [Spirit](https://github.com/null2264/spirit) (and Akkoma/Pleroma). Developed specifically for [fedi.aap](https://fedi.aap.my.id) Spirit instance.

This fork was created because I do not want to be associated with the original project's maintainer or their controversial opinions.

## Troubleshoot

### Posts / Notifications refuses to load (Akkoma/Spirit/Pleroma)

This may be caused by a bottleneck in your system. You try adjusting your postgresql config with the configuration from [PGTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/), or simply upgrade your server.
